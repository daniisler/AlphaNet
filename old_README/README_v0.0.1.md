# AlphaNet

We present **AlphaNet**, a local frame-based equivariant model designed to tackle the challenges of achieving both accurate and efficient simulations for atomistic systems.  **AlphaNet** enhances computational efficiency and accuracy by leveraging the local geometric structures of atomic environments through the construction of equivariant local frames and learnable frame transitions. Notably, AlphaNet offers one of the best trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy among existing models. Moreover, AlphaNet exhibits scalability across a broad spectrum of system and dataset sizes, affirming its versatility.

## Installation Guide

### Installation Steps

1. **Create a Conda Environment**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   conda create -n alphanet_env python=3.8 #or later version
   ```

2. **Activate the Environment**

   ```bash
   conda activate alphanet_env
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   Navigate to your desired installation directory and run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AlphaNet.git
   ```

5. **Install AlphaNet**

   Navigate into the cloned repository and install AlphaNet in editable mode:

   ```bash
   cd AlphaNet
   pip install -e .
   ```

   This allows you to make changes to the codebase and have them reflected without reinstalling the package.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

The settings are put into a config file, you can see the json files provided as example, or see comments in `alphanet/config.py` for some help. 
Our code is based on pytorch-lightning, and in this version we provide command line interaction, which makes AlphaNet easier to use. However if you are already familar with python and torch, which is not that hard, it would be great to use the model in a torch way and do further exploration. In all there are 4 commands:
1. Train a model:

```bash 
alpha-train example.json # use --help to see more functions, like multi-gpu training resuming from ckpt...
```
2. Evaluate a model and draw diagonal plot:
```bash 
alpha-eval -c example.json -m /path/to/ckpt # use --help to see more functions
```
3. Convert from lightning ckpt to state_dict ckpt:
```bash 
alpha-conv -i in.ckpt -o out.ckpt # use --help to see more functions
```
4. Freeze a model:
```bash 
alpha-freeze -c in.config -m in.ckpt -o out.pt # use --help to see more functions
```
The functions above can also be used in a script way like previous version, see `old_README`.


To prepare dataset in format of pickle, you can use:

1. from deepmd:

```bash 
python scripts/dp2pic_batch.py
```

2. from extxyz:

```bash 
python scripts/xyz2pic.py
```

There is also an ase calculator:

```python 
from alphanet.infer.calc import AlphaNetCalculator
from alphanet.config import All_Config
# example usage
atoms = bulk('Cu', 'fcc', a=3.6, cubic=True)

calculator = AlphaNetCalculator(
        ckpt_path='./alex_0410.ckpt',
        device = 'cuda',
        precision = '32',
        config=All_Config().from_json('./pretrained/OMA/oma.json'),
)

atoms.calc = calculator
print(atoms.get_potential_energy())
```
